      <h1>Welcome</h1>

      <p>
        Ada Lovelace (1815-1852) was deemed the world’s first computer
        programmer. She worked with Charles Babbage, who created the
        Analytical Engine, a mechanical computer that took instructions
        via punched notecards. Ada saw the future of computers, rather
        than the Engine’s physical and mathematical purposes as Babbage
        did. She knew that numbers could also be symbols and commands.
      </p>
      <p>
	This is a simulation of Ada’s ideas, and is very similar to
	early microcomputers. You can enter commands and numbers in the
	black box. The commands are listed on the side, you can type
	them in either number (4) or letter (INC) form. Start with a
	command, and making sure a number (not another command)
	follows it. For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        If we type in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 2 &lt;- command to load the next number into the x-register
        <li> 3 &lt;- an actual number (which is in the x-register)
        <li> 4 &lt;- increment the number in the x-register by 1
      </ul>
      <p>
        Pressing load puts the code you typed into memory files. Press
        step to show the first step (putting 3 in the x-register), and
        press step again to show the final step (add 1 to 3). Which
        leaves up with the number 4 in the x-register.
      </p>

      <p>
        The three rows on top of the wire image (load, run, and step)
        are modeling the inside of the computer. In real computers, you
        would never see this part. The boxes are memory spots, and each
        box can hold on to a number. Once you have assigned a number to
        a memory location (with command 1), the number will appear in a
        register.
      </p>
      <p>
	These commands can not only be operations (such as adding,
	incrementing by 1), but can also be commands to turn on a
	light or play a sound. The four lights on the bottom can also
	be programmed with the Run row. Since the run row starts with
	memory spot 129 (you can ignore 128 for now) we will have to
	assign a number to that spot:
      </p>
      <p>
        If we type in
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;- sets the memory box
        <li> 129 &lt;- the memory box we want to use
        <li> 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;- the number we want in the memory box
      </ul>
      <p>
        Since a number (other than 0) is now in the run row, the first
        light turns on, and since that number is a 4 this turns the
        light blue.  You can do some fun programs while playing around
        with this simulator. And even make your own commands too!
