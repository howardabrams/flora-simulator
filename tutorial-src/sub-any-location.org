While the monkey, I mean, computer, can read /any location/, it can
only read a location that actually exists.

Alan Turing's original idea was that the strip was /infinitely long/.
Infinite Strips are hard to find, but the longer this strip, the more
your computer can do.

When I was a kid, I upgraded my computer to have 48,000 cells on the
strip of memory (actually, 49,152 cells to be precise). I thought 48K
was a lot, but I bet the phone in your pocket has 8,000,000,000 cells
or more!
