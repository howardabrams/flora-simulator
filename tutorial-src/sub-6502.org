The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502][6502]] was an 8-bit computer processor that came out in 1975. Since
it was cheap, had lots of features, and could shoot lasers if held the
right way, it became very popular and kicked-started the
/microcomputer revolution/.

It was the core of Steve Wozniak's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II][original Apple]] computer, as well as
the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family][Atari]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64][Commodore 64]], and even the first game consoles from
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System][Nintendo]].

While it was produced 40 years ago, it is still manufactured and used
in select systems, even though most personal computers have moved on
to larger, more powerful processors.
